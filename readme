This program analyzes mate pair positions

================================================
@ PARAMETERS

-f <input file path> : the path has to be the full path of a BAM file
-c <chromosome name> : i.e chrV 
-rs <region start position> : if you want to focus on a specific region. Put the start position here
-re <region end position> : if you want to focus on a specific region. Put the end position here
** -rs -re has to be provided together. And -c chromosome name has to be provided
-t <threshold> : when you are tring to focus on the mate pairs that have both end mapped to same 
	chromosome. You can set the distance between two ends of one mate pair using -t. 
	i.e: -t 2000 means only the mate pair that has two ends that are 2000bp away will be printed


* -f CANNOT BE EMPTY
* DEFAULT (if only the file name was provided) : mate pairs on all the chromosomes will be analyzed


=================================================
@ OUTPUT FILES

* result_DEFAULT : DEFAULT analysis result directory. All the chromosomes were analyzed and result 
	files are in this directory
	* For each chromosome, one dir was generated
* result_chromosome : if one chromosome was specified, this dir will be genrated
* chromosome1.chromosome2.matepairs : contains all the mate pairs that have one end on chromosome1 
	and the other end on chromosome2
* chromosome1.threshold.matepairs : contains all the mate pairs that have both end on chromosome1
	and two ends are <threshold>bp away from each other
* chromosome1.chromosome2.png : a graph contains mate pair positions. (chromosome2 vs chromosome1)
